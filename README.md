# ðŸ§  Multi-Threaded CPU Scheduler Simulator (C)

This project is a simulation of basic CPU scheduling algorithms implemented in the C programming language using POSIX threads (`pthreads`). It supports:

- âœ… First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS)
- âœ… Round Robin (RR)

Processes are simulated as threads, and scheduling logic determines the order and duration of their execution.

## ðŸ›  Features

- Multithreaded simulation using `pthread`
- FCFS: Executes one process at a time in order of arrival
- Round Robin: Time-sliced execution of processes
- Clean modular code structure
- Ready for terminal/command-line execution
